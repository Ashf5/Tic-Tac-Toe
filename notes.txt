steps in the minimax algorithm:
the numbers are 1 for a win, -1 for a loss, and 0 for a tie game

the highest algorithm takes in a state and returns the move with the highest score from the moves that the lowest function returns
the lowest function takes the lowest score from all the moves that the highest functions returns
